# Lesson 1
    
# Write a program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number.
# Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder.e.g. 86 is even because 86 Ã· 2 = 43
#43 does not have any decimal places. Therefore the division is clean.
# e.g. 59 is odd because 59 Ã· 2 = 29.5
# 29.5 is not a whole number, it has decimal places. Therefore there is a remainder of 0.5, so the division is not clean.
# The modulo is written as a percentage sign (%) in Python. It gives you the remainder after a division.
# e.g.
# 6 Ã· 2 = 3 with no remainder.
# therefore: 6 % 2 = 0
# 5 Ã· 2 = 2 x 2 + 1, remainder is 1.
# therefore: 5 % 2 = 1
# 14 Ã· 4 = 3 x 4 + 2, remainder is 2.
# therefore: 14 % 4 = 2
# Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.
# Example 1 Input
# 43
# Example 1 Output
# This is an odd number.
    
# #Â Which number do you want to check?
# number = int(input())
# # ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# # Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
# if number % 2 == 0:
#     print('This is an even number.')

# else:
#     print('This is an odd number.')

# Else Statement


# /Nested if/else statement
# if condition:
#     if another condition:
#     else: 
#         do this
# else:
#     do this

# print("Welcome to the rollercoaster!")
# height = int(input("What is your height in cm? "))

# if height >= 120:
#     print('You can ride the rollercoaster!')

# Lesson 2 actually
    
# Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.
# It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.
# Under 18.5 they are underweight
# Equal to or over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
# Equal to or over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
# Equal to or over 30 but below 35 they are obese
# Equal to or over 35 they are clinically obese.
    
# Enter your height in meters e.g., 1.55
height = float(input())
# Enter your weight in kilograms e.g., 72
weight = int(input())
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
bmi = weight / (height * height)
if bmi < 18.5:
    print(f'Your BMI is {bmi}, you are underweight')
elif bmi < 25:
    print(f'Your BMI id {bmi}, you have a normal weight.')
elif bmi < 30:
    print(f'Your BMI is {bmi}, you are slightly overweight.')
elif bmi < 35:
    print(f'Your BMI is {bmi}, you are obese.')
else:
    print(f'Your BMI is {bmi}, you are clinically obese.')
